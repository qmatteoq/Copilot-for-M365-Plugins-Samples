## Exercise 2 - Run sample app as a plugin for Microsoft 365 Copilot

## Step 1 - Set up the project for first use

Open your working folder in Visual Studio Code.

Teams Toolkit stores environment variables in the **env** folder, and it will fill in all the values automatically when you start your project the first time. However there's one value that's specific to the sample application, and that's the connection string for accessing the Northwind database.

In this project, the Northwind database is stored in Azure Table Storage; when you're debugging locally, it uses the [Azurite](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite?tabs=visual-studio) storage emulator. That's mostly built into the project, but the project won't build unless you provide the connection string.

The necessary setting is provided in a file **env/.env.local.user.sample**. Make a copy of this file in the **env** folder, and call it **.env.local.user**. This is where secret or sensitive settings are stored.

If you're not sure how to do this, here are the steps in Visual Studio Code. Expand the **env** folder and right click on **.env.local.user.sample**. Select "Copy". Then right click anywhere in the **env** folder and select "Paste". You will have a new file called **.env.local.user copy.sample**. Use the same context menu to rename the file to **.env.local.user** and you're done.

![Copy .env.local.user.sample to .env.local.user](./images/02-01-Setup-Project-01.png)

The resulting **.env.local.user** file should contain this line:

~~~text
SECRET_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_CONNECTION_STRING=UseDevelopmentStorage=true
~~~

(OK it's not a secret! But it could be; if you deploy the project to Azure it will be!)

# Step 2 - Run the application locally

Click F5 to start debugging, or click the start button 1️⃣. You will have an opportunity to select a debugging profile; select Debug in Teams (Edge) 2️⃣ or choose another profile.

![Run application locally](./images/02-02-Run-Project-01.png)

If you see the following screen, you need to fix your **env/.env.local.user** file; this is explained in the previous step.

![Error is displayed because of a missing environment variable](./images/02-01-Setup-Project-06.png)

The first time your app runs, you may be prompted to allow NodeJS to go through your firewall; this is necessary to allow the application to communicate.

It may take a while the first time as it's loading all the npm packages. Eventually, a browser window will open and invite you to log in.

![Browser window opens with a login form](./images/02-02-Run-Project-03.png)

Once you're in, Microsoft Teams should open up and display a dialog offering to install your application.
Take note of the information displayed; which is from the [app manifest](../appPackage/manifest.json).

Click "Add" to add Northwind Inventory as a personal application.

![App installation screen with large Add button](./images/02-02-Run-Project-04.png)

You should be directed to a chat within the application, however you could use the app in any chat.

## Step 3 - Test in Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 (single parameter)

Begin by clicking the "Try the new Teams" switch to move to the new Teams client application.

> IMPORTANT - Copilot for Microsoft 365 only works in the "New" Teams. Please don't miss this step! 

> If you restart your debugger after switching to "New" teams, you may get an error message after the debugger starts. This is a known problem; please just close the error dialog and continue testing.

In the left navigation, click on "Copilot" to open Copilot. You can find it also in the Chat section.

Check the lower left of the chat user interface, below the compose box. You should see a plugin icon 1️⃣ . Click this and enable the Northwind Inventory plugin 2️⃣ .

![Small panel with a toggle for each plugin](./images/03-02-Plugin-Panel.png)

> NOTE: In the Build lab you may see a second "Northwind Inventory" app, with an icon that has a yellow background. We've hosted a copy of Northwind Inventory in Microsoft Azure and installed this app into the lab tenants. While it's there as a fallback, if you want to see the queries in your log window you need to use the copy with the blue background, which is the local running copy of the app.

For best results, start a new chat by typing "New chat" before each prompt or set of related prompts.

During the introduction of the lab, the instructors have guided you to understand the basic building blocks of the messaging extension, by highlighting the relevant snippets in manifest and in code that powers up the experience. In case you need a refresh, or if you're attending the lab on-demand, you can review the [code tour section of the lab](Optional%20-%20Code%20tour.md), which contains a detailed explanation of the project's structure.

![Copilot showing its new chat screen](./images/03-01-New-Chat.png)

Here are some prompts to try that use only a single parameter of the message extension:

* "Find information about Chai in Northwind Inventory"

* "Find discounted seafood in Northwind. Show a table with the products, supplier names, and the average discount rate."

See if this last one also locates any of the documents you uploaded to your OneDrive.

As you're testing, watch the log messages within your application. You should be able to see when Copilot calls your plugin. For example, after requesting "discounted seafood items", Copilot issued this query using the "discountSearch" command.

![Log file shows a discount search for seafood](./images/03-02a-Query-Log1.png)

You may see citations of the Northwind data in 3 forms. If there's a single reference, Copilot may show the whole card.

![Adaptive card for Chai embedded in a Copilot response](./images/03-03a-response-on-chai.png)

If there are multiple references, Copilot may show a small number next to each. You can hover over these numbers to display the adaptive card. References will also be listed below the response.

![Reference numbers embedded in a Copilot response - hovering over the number shows the adaptive card](./images/03-03-Response-on-Chai.png)

Try using these adaptive cards to take action on the products. Notice that this doesn't affect earlier responses from Copilot.

Feel free to try making up your own prompts. You'll find that they only work if Copilot is able to query the plugin for the required information. This underscores the need to anticipate the kinds of prompts users will issue, and providing corresponding types of queries for each one. Having multiple parameters will make this more powerful!

### Troubleshooting tip
If you're facing challenges while testing your plugin, you can enable 'developer mode'. Developer mode provides information on the plugin selected by the Copilot orchestrator to respond to the prompt. It also shows the available functions in the plugin and the API call's status code.

To enable developer mode, type the following into Copilot:
```
-developer on
```
For additional information on common problems and how to fix them, see the  [troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md) guide.

Now just execute your prompt. This time, the output will look like this: 

![The developer mode in action](./images/03-03b-developer-mode.png)

As you can notice, below the response generated by Copilot, we have a table that provides us insightful information about what happened behind the scenes:

- Under **Enabled plugins**, we can see that Copilot has identified that the Northwind Inventory plugin is enabled.
- Under **Matched functions**, we can see that Copilot has determined that the Northwind inventory plugin offers three functions: `inventorySearch`, `discountSearch`, and `companySearch`.
- Under **Selected functions for execution**, we can see that Copilot has selected the `inventorySearch` function to respond to the prompt.
- Under **Function execution details**, we can see some detailed information about the execution, like the HTTP response returned by the plugin to the Copilot engine.


## Step 4 - Test in Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 (multiple parameters)

In this exercise, you'll try some prompts that exercise the multi-parameter feature in the sample plugin. These prompts will request data that can be retrieved by name, category, inventory status, supplier city, and stock level, as defined in [the manifest](../appPackage/manifest.json).

For example, try prompting "Find Northwind beverages with more than 100 items in stock". To respond, Copilot must identify products:

* where the category is "beverages"
* where inventory status is "in stock"
* where the stock level is more than 100

If you look at the log file, you can see that Copilot was able to understand this requirement and fill in 3 of the parameters in the first message extension command.

![Screen shot of log showing a query for categoryName=beverages and stockLevel=100- ](./images/03-06-Find-Northwind-Beverages-with-more-than-100.png)

The plugin code applies all three filters, providing a result set of just 4 products. Using the information on the 4 resulting adaptive cards, Copilot renders a result similar to this:

![Copilot produced a bulleted list of products with references](./images/03-06b-Find-Northwind-Beverages-with-more-than-100.png)

By using this prompt, Copilot might look also in your OneDrive files to find the payment terms with each supplier's contract. In this case, you will notice that some of the references won't have the Northwind Inventory icon, but the Word one.

![Copilot extracted payment terms from contracts in SharePoint](./images/03-06c-PaymentTerms.png)

Here are some more prompts to try:

* "Find Northwind dairy products that are low on stock. Show me a table with the product, supplier, units in stock and on order."

* "We’ve been receiving partial orders for Tofu. Find the supplier in Northwind and draft an email summarizing our inventory and reminding them they should stop sending partial orders per our MOQ policy."

* "Northwind will have a booth at Microsoft Community Days in London. Find products with local suppliers and write a LinkedIn post to promote the booth and products."

    Request an enhancement by prompting,

    "Emphasize how delicious the products are and encourage people to attend our booth"

* "What beverage is high in demand due to social media that is low stock in Northwind in London. Reference the product details to update stock."

Which prompts work best for you? Try making up your own prompts and observe your log messages to see how Copilot accesses your plugin.

## Congratulations

You have completed Exercise 2.
Please proceed to [Exercise 3](Exercise%2004%20-%20Code%20tour.md) in which you will add a new command to the messaging extension.
